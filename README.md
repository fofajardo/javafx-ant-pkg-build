# Ant build file for packaging JavaFX projects

I was looking for a way to distribute JavaFX programs to other people without them having to install the necessary Java runtime and JavaFX SDK prerequisites and compile the project's source code themselves. I looked at e(fx)clipse and while it did provide an autogenerated Ant build file, it was out of date, uses the outdated `javapackager`, and simply doesn't work with modern JavaFX projects.

Since I'd rather not use Maven/Gradle/another third-party plugin just to package the project that I'm working on, I decided to create my own Ant build file that should be compatible with the `jlink` and `jpackage` tools. This will likely work only with Java 14 and above (since that's when the `jpackage` tool was introduced).

## Usage
- Copy the entire `/build` directory to your JavaFX project.
- If using Eclipse, either run the Ant build from the primary toolbar or right-click on the `build.xml` file on the Project Explorer list, select Run As, and choose `Ant Build`.
- `jpackage` might require [WiX](https://wixtoolset.org/) to be installed.
