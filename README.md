# Ant build file for packaging JavaFX projects

I was looking for a method to distribute JavaFX programs to others without requiring them to install the necessary Java runtime and JavaFX SDK prerequisites or compile the project's source code themselves. While exploring e(fx)clipse, I discovered that although it provided an autogenerated Ant build file, it was outdated, relied on the obsolete `javapackager` tool, and simply didn't work with modern JavaFX projects.

Since I preferred not use Maven, Gradle, or another third-party plugin just to package the project that I'm working on, I opted to create my own Ant build file. This should be compatible with the `jlink` and `jpackage` tools. However, it's worth noting that this approach will likely only work with Java 14 and above, as that's when the `jpackage` tool was introduced."

## Usage
- Copy the entire `/build` directory to your JavaFX project.
- If you are using Eclipse, you can either run the Ant build from the primary toolbar or right-click on the `build.xml` file in the Project Explorer list, select Run As, and choose `Ant Build`.
- Note that `jpackage` might require [WiX](https://wixtoolset.org/) to be installed.
